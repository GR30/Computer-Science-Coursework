Link to my code in ISwift online playground.

I'm actually unsure if this code will run properly 
because at a certain point when making arrays, I swift's 
playground scripts began to timeout. 

I continued to craft this code despite this, 
but I feel as if I asked the playground to do too much. 

I immediately attempted to use Visual Studio Code,
but for some reason I'm unable to find the swift extentions
that this website gives
(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
from within the program like it says.

Tomorrow I'll be going to the computer science lab 
to try using a Mac to continue.
